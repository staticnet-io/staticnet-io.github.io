## 2024
What were some of the goals I set for 2024?
- More Ansible
    - I wanted to use Ansible more, both in my job, and in the homelab environment
    - How did that go?
        - Success!
- More Python
    - same as with Ansible, I wanted to practice using Python more, both at work and in the homelab
    - How did that go?
        - Success!
- More AWS networking
    - I had some AWS learning resources available, so I wanted to make an effort to use them and possibly take a certification exam
    - How did that go?
        - not as much progress as I'd hoped
- Cisco Certification exam?
    - I had a free test at Cisco Live.
    - How did that go?
        - I failed the test, but it was still a good learning experience!
- More Blog posts
    - Make an effort to create more blog posts when Iâ€™m working on studying or learning something new, or maybe to write up the steps for a project in the home lab, or whatever
    - How did that go?
        - not as much progress as I'd hoped
