## 2024

Earlier in the year I set some professional development goals for the remainder of 2024 . This is something I've done here and there in the past, but I want to be more consistent with goal setting and review going forward.

What were some of the goals I set for 2024? 
- More Ansible
    - I wanted to use Ansible more, both in my job, and in the homelab environment
    - How did that go?

Success! I may have used Ansible less than I wanted to this year, but I definitely used it more than the past year.

- More Python
    - same as with Ansible, I wanted to practice using Python more, both at work and in the homelab
    - How did that go?

Success! I've done a lot more with Python this year, and hope to keep that momentum going into 2025 and beyond.

- More AWS networking
    - I had some AWS learning resources available, so I wanted to make an effort to use them and possibly take a certification exam
    - How did that go?


not as much progress as I'd hoped

- Cisco Certification exam
    - I had a free test at Cisco Live.
    - How did that go?


I took the Cisco DevNet Associate exam (DEVASC), with basically zero preparation time. I failed the test, but it was still a good learning experience!

---
- More Blog posts
    - Make an effort to create more blog posts when Iâ€™m working on studying or learning something new, or maybe to write up the steps for a project in the home lab, or whatever
    - How did that go?



not as much progress as I'd hoped, but we are here at the end of the year with a new blog site and more blog posts, so not a complete fail!
