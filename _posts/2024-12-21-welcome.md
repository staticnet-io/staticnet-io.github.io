This site is where I write about network engineering, automation, music, gaming, technology, and whatever else I feel like sharing. Some posts will include detailed technical information, others might be quick thoughts on something random. Think of it as part personal knowledge base, part public notebook.

Whether you're here to read about something related to network engineering and automation, gaming, music, or just stumbled in by chance - make yourself at home. I write both for myself and for anyone who might find these topics interesting. No regular schedule, no content strategy - just genuine enthusiasm about things I care about.
