# My 2025 Goals: Embracing Automation, Network Engineering, and Professional Growth

As we approach 2025, I've been reflecting on where I want to focus my energy and growth. My goals span across professional certifications, growing my technical skills, content creation, and personal health. Here's my roadmap for the year ahead:

## Professional Certification Advancement

A major priority for 2025 is renewing my Cicso certifications. I plan to approach this strategically by aligning it with my automation goals. Here are my certification plans:

- Explore Cisco DevNet certification paths that complement my certification renewal requirements
- Look into earning qualifying Continuing Education (CE) credits through Cisco's automation and programmability courses
- Consider pursuing the Cisco DevNet Professional certification, which would both advance my automation skills and fulfill some certification renewal requirements
- Document my certification journey through blog posts to possibly help others pursuing similar paths

## Mastering Ansible for Network Automation

As a network engineer, I'm committed to deepening my expertise with Ansible. Here are some specific project ideas I am considering:

### Potential Work Projects:
- Develop an Ansible playbook for standardized network device configurations
- Continue working on automated backup solutions for network configurations, potentially with version control integration
- Build compliance checking automation to ensure network devices meet security standards
- Implement automated network testing and validation workflows
- Design self-service portals for common network changes using Ansible Tower/AWX

### Homelab Projects:
- Set up a multi-node Kubernetes cluster using Ansible for infrastructure as code
- Create automated DNS and DHCP management system
- Build a network monitoring solution with automated remediation
- Implement automated VM provisioning and management
- Develop a CI/CD pipeline for network configurations

## Expanding Python Skills in Network Engineering

Python will be a key focus for automating and scaling network environments:

### Potential Work Projects:
- Develop custom Python scripts for network health monitoring and reporting
- Create a Python-based API wrapper for common network operations
- Build automation tools for log analysis and troubleshooting
- Implement network capacity planning tools using Python data analysis
- Design a Python-based network inventory management system

### Homelab Projects:
- Create a network topology visualization tool using Python and GraphViz
- Develop a bandwidth usage analyzer with historical trending
- Build a network security scanning and reporting tool
- Implement a Python-based network configuration analyzer
- Create automated network documentation tools

## Consistent Content Creation

To share my learning journey and contribute to the technical community, I'm committing to regular blog posts covering things like:

- Network automation case studies and lessons learned
- Tutorial series on Ansible and Python for network engineers
- Deep dives into specific networking technologies and protocols
- Homelab setup guides and project walkthroughs
- Reviews of network automation tools and frameworks
- Career development insights for network engineers

## Personal Health and Fitness

While technical growth is important, physical health provides the foundation for everything else. My fitness plan includes:

- Establishing a consistent workout schedule: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings
- Creating a balanced routine combining strength training and cardio
- Setting specific, measurable fitness milestones for each quarter
- Implementing a habit tracking system to maintain accountability
- Planning meal prep to support fitness goals

## Success Metrics

To keep myself accountable, I'll track:

- Progress toward CCNP renewal through CE credits or exam completion
    - Completion of DevNet training modules and certifications
- Monthly completion of at least one major automation project
- Weekly code commits to personal and professional repositories
- Monthly blog post publications, at minimum
- Weekly workout attendance and progress measurements

2025 will be a year of growth, automation, and building healthy habits. By focusing on these key areas, I aim to enhance both my professional capabilities and personal well-being.
