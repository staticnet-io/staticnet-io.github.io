Hey! I'm TJ - a network engineer by day who has way too many interests and hobbies for my free time. 

You'll find posts here ranging from technical deep-dives on networking and automation topics, some homelab work I'm doing, or whatever other randomness I feel like sharing. Some articles might be carefully crafted documentation or guides, others are quick notes I'm saving for future reference.

Feel free to [reach out]({% link _pages/contact.md %}) if anything resonates with you.



Some of my hobbies and interests:
- traveling
- IT automation, python, ansible, etc
- video games (PC, VR, Console, Handheld -- I enjoy them all)
- homelab things
- music production
- watching TV shows and Movies
- watching sports
- skiing
- hiking
- technology in general
