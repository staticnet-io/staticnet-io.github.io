Hey! I'm TJ - a network engineer by day who has way too many interests and hobbies for my free time: 

- technology
- homelab things
- IT automation, python, ansible, etc
- video games (mostly PC, some VR, some Xbox)
- music production
- watching TV shows and Movies
- watching sports
- skiing
- hiking

You'll find posts here ranging from technical deep-dives on networking and automation topics, some homelab work I'm doing, or whatever other randomness I feel like sharing. Some articles are carefully crafted documentation or guides, others are quick notes I'm saving for future reference.

Feel free to [reach out]({% link _pages/contact.md %}) if anything resonates with you.
